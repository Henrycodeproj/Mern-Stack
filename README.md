# Unplug 
 
 **MERN STACK**
 
**About:** This is my most current project. I want to create an application for college students to connect and help them break through the ice to be more involved in college. This idea comes was inspired from my time in college. Although I had only been at the university for two years before graduating, I noticed that there were many opportunities to get involved, whether it was clubs, classes, etc. but there was a strong social barrier to get through. It would be hard to find friends if you were active around these clubs or classes, especially if you were trying to break into an already formed group. So my goal in making this project is to provide college students a platform to just post whatever they're doing, whether its on campus for a game night, or a finding a friend to go join a club. This platform will hopefully provide an open invite to the students and each other. Because I love face-to-face interaction, I really want to foster these interactions especially when students are surrounded by individuals who are like minded and have common interest like meeting people and getting involved.
 
 **Goal:** I wanted to connect students and foster face-to-face interactions with their own campus body because college loneliness is a real problem.
